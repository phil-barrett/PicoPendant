# Pico Pendant V1.0

This is a Raspberry Pico based design.  It is designed to connect a Pendant/MPG to a grblHAL machine via either UART or I2C using the grblHAL [Keypad plugin interface](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_keypad). I may have some bare boards available. If there is sufficient interest, I will put together a kit with the needed parts.  Let me know in the discussions section if you are interested.
